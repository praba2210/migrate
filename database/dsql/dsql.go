// Package dsql implements the database.Driver interface for Amazon Aurora DSQL.
//
// Aurora DSQL speaks PostgreSQL's wire protocol, but two of its behaviors make the
// existing postgres and pgx drivers unusable against it:
//
//   - pg_advisory_lock and pg_advisory_unlock are unsupported (SQLSTATE 0A000), so the
//     migration lock is a row in a table.
//   - TRUNCATE is unsupported, so SetVersion clears the version table with a DELETE that
//     has no WHERE clause.
//
// Separately, DSQL permits at most one DDL statement per transaction and no mixing of DDL
// with DML. Neither postgres nor pgx wraps a migration file in an explicit transaction
// either, so that is a constraint on how migrations are written rather than a difference
// in the driver. See the README.
//
// This driver's own two tables are schema-qualified from x-migrations-schema or
// CURRENT_SCHEMA(), which covers WithInstance too, whose caller supplies a pool this driver
// never configures. Open additionally honors search_path from the URL, as the postgres and
// pgx drivers do, so CURRENT_SCHEMA() resolves from it and x-migrations-schema stays an
// override. It takes a pool hook, because the connector replaces ConnConfig.RuntimeParams
// while building the pool; see poolConfigFor.
//
// IAM authentication and optimistic-concurrency retry are delegated to the AWS connector
// (github.com/awslabs/aurora-dsql-connectors/go/pgx) rather than reimplemented here.
// Open builds its pool, so a DSQL URL carries no password: a token is generated per
// connection. WithInstance does not resolve credentials or build connections, so callers
// who bring their own *sql.DB are unaffected by that.
//
// Unlike the postgres drivers this one does not pin a single *sql.Conn. Those pin one
// because an advisory lock is session-scoped; our lock is a table row, so database/sql may
// hand out any connection. That matters on DSQL, which closes every connection at 60
// minutes: a pinned connection would cap a migration run at an hour and would stop the
// connector's 55-minute recycling from ever firing.
//
// Migrations that build an index are asynchronous on DSQL: CREATE INDEX ASYNC returns a
// job_id once the build is enqueued. Run waits for that job before returning, so the version
// migrate marks clean afterwards describes a schema that is actually in place. See
// applyStatement.
